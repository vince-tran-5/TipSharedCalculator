# TipSharedCalculator
Shared Tip Calculator using Android Studio. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Develop a Shared Bill Calculator. The Shared Bill Tip Calculator considers the subtotal, number of participants, sales tax percentage, and tip percentage to calculate the tip per person, as well as the total cost per person. Tax is included when calculating the tip.


2) The user should be able to select state (either from a drop down box or enter in an EditText). Having just 3 states is enough (let's say CA, OR, and VA). Different states have different tax rates.

3) The calculator will only perform calculation when subtotal is positive, number of participants is a positive integer, sales tax percentage and tip percentage is a valid percentage. Otherwise, it will display an error message.

4) Extend and update TipCalculator Class.

5) Display tip per person and the total cost per person in TextViews or other widgets you select.
